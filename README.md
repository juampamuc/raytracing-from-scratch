Errata
------

This course is certainly not perfect. One known "issue" is that the Phong-like illumination model does not have a correct diffuse component, although this is not immediately noticeable.


Code
====

The code is split into "levels" which follow the structure of the course. Each level introduces a new concept and builds on the foundation of the prior levels.
